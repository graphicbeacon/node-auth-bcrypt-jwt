# node-auth-bcrypt-jwt

An experimental project exploring NodeJS authentication with bcrypt hashing and json web tokens. This is still on-going.

**Please Note:** This application currently does not have an associated UI, so you will have to access the endpoints using a REST Client like [Chrome's Postman plugin].

To run, simply follow the below instructions:
* Run `npm install` to update local dependencies
* Run `node index` to start localhost server on port 4000
